Hello, my name is Joel, and I like snails

Hi everyone! My name is Sarah and I am a senior majoring in Biomedical Sciences.  Over the summer I helped make robots for the MechE department.  I am looking forwards to learning more about Bioinformatics because I really enjoy computer science and programming :)

I'm Anthony, generally I just go by Tony or AB. I am a third year PhD student in the Biotechnology program. I have a dog named Haku that is a boxer-terrier mix and I enjoy running!

Hello, my name is Annika and I'm a senior double majoring in Biology and Mathematics.

Hi, I'm Riley and I have a pack of Shih-Tzus! We got a pregnant rescue who had five puppies, which are still part of our family even if they've been adopted. Their names are Biscochito, Bruno, Sassy, Jack, Tracy, and Moo!

Hello, my name is Shimaa, and I like music.
