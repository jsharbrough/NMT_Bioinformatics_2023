Hello, my name is Joel, and I like snails

Hi everyone! My name is Sarah and I am a senior majoring in Biomedical Sciences.  Over the summer I helped make robots for the MechE department.  I am looking forwards to learning more about Bioinformatics because I really enjoy computer science and programming :)

I'm Anthony, generally I just go by Tony or AB. I am a third year PhD student in the Biotechnology program. I have a dog named Haku that is a boxer-terrier mix and I enjoy running!

Hi, I'm Riley and I have a pack of Shih-Tzus! We got a pregnant rescue who had five puppies, which are still part of our family even if they've been adopted. Their names are Biscochito, Bruno, Sassy, Jack, Tracy, and Moo!
